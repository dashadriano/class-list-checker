# Class List Checker
Class List Checker System. Fully built on Python.
<br />
# Abstract
A command line interface based program, the Class List Checker is a small scale Python program that takes into account the students that a teacher manages for a class.

This version of a student management system aims to help teachers handle a class, visualizing the students within a class instance, to cross check against a physical or static class list. Utilizing basic to intermediate programming concepts to execute the needed operations for the program, the Student Management System has a neat local console UI to aid even non-technical individuals in using it, including an automatic console clear before proceeding to the next operational step when in use. 

# How It Works
As a small scale project, class list checker only utilizes a single python file. 

In `main.py` two functions are defined to run the program. 

`studentManagement()` and `continueAgain()` work hand in hand, with `studentManagement()` as the main `App` instantiation and with the `continueAgain()` call as the program loop regulator.

For a more in-depth look, view `main.py` for the code.

# How To Use
To use, simply download Python and download `main.py` from this repository. Double click `main.py`.

Alternatively, for individuals that want to view the code while running the program to understand the abstracted part of the project, simply run `main.py` in any code editor.

A straightforward list of choices for operating the program will be prompted at start up.
